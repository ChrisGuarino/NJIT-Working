## My name is Chris Guarino. I currently am a process engineer at IBM Thomas J. Watson Research Center. I primarily conduct research in various Chemical Etching and Electrochemistry techniques in the fabrication of developing semiconductors. Although I enjoy and find this to be challenging work I have found that I would enjoy working more intimately with software. 

## Currently the field that I would like to eventually concentrate on is Machine Learning. 
## I am still very early in my journey and am extremely excited about delving more into the world of Computer Science and Mathematics.
